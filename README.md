# CardFileFinalProject
Card file of text materials is a website built with .NET and Angular.
Guests (non-registered users) can view all articles (text materials) and apply sorting, filtering, searching to them.
They also can read the article itself along with its information including title, category, author, date of creation, number of likes and comments.
Logged in users have access to publishing their own articles, liking other articles, saving them and sending them as a pdf file on email.
They also can comment articles. There's a way to subscribe/unsubcribe to/from receiving notifications on email if several actions happen, change user name and email.
Their own articles won't be published right away as they need to be approved by manager or admin first.
Articles can be in three states: pending (means that it hasn't been approved or rejected yet), approved or rejected.
Managers are in charge of approving and rejecting the articles.
Admin also has rights to approve and reject articles. What's more, they also can delete an article if it's inappropriate.
They can create/delete categories, assign/remove roles to/from users, ban/unban users.
